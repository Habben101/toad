                                "Having spent nearly a year in East Africa, I
                                recognize that the only way to lift up this part
                                of the world is to start treating them as part
                                of the global economy. No one is talking about
                                outsourcing to Africa, but its a huge mistake.
                                There are so many smart people, ready to do the
                                hard work that we can't afford to do ourselves.
                                Every construction job should be completed in 3D
                                before a human starts work. It is imperative to
                                the safety of construction workers, all of our
                                time and resources, and of course the bottom
                                line."
